As I was going to St. Ives,
I met a man with seven wives;
Every wife had seven sacks,
Every sack had seven cats,
Every cat had seven kits;
Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,
How many were there going to St. Ives?

As round as an apple,
As deep as a cup,
All the king's horses
Can't pull it up.

Baa, baa, black sheep, Have you any wool? Yes sir, yes sir, Three bags full;
One for my master, One for my dame, And one for the little boy That lives in our lane.
Blow, wind, blow! And go, mill, go!
That the miller may grind his corn;
That the baker may take it,
And into rolls make it,
And send us some hot in the morn.

Bow, wow, wow,
Whose dog art thou?
Little Tom Tinker's dog,
Bow, wow, wow.

Bye, baby bunting,
Father's gone a-hunting,
Mother's gone a-milking,
Sister's gone a-silking,
Brother's gone to buy a skin
To wrap the baby bunting in.

A cat came fiddling out of a barn,
With a pair of bagpipes under her arm;
She could sing nothing but fiddle cum fee,
The mouse has married the bumblebee.

Cobbler, cobbler, mend my shoe,
Give it a stitch and that will do.
Here's a nail, and there's a prod,
And now my shoe is well shod.

Cock-a-doodle-doo! My dame has lost her shoe; My master's lost his fiddling stick, And don't know what to do.
Cock-a-doodle-doo! What is my dame to do? Till master finds his fiddling stick, She'll dance without her shoe.
Cock-a-doodle-doo! My dame has found her shoe, And master's found his fiddling stick, Sing doodle-doodle-doo!
Cock-a-doodle-doo! My dame will dance with you, While master fiddles his fiddling stick For dame and doodle-doo!
Come, butter, come,
Come, butter, come!
Peter stands at the gate,
Waiting for a buttered cake;
Come, butter, come.

Cushy cow bonny, let down thy milk,
And I will give thee a gown of silk;
A gown of silk and a silver tee,
If thou wilt let down thy milk to me.

Diddle, diddle, dumpling, my son John
Went to bed with his stockings on;
One shoe off, and one shoe on,
Diddle, diddle, dumpling, my son John.

Ding, dong, bell, Pussy's in the well! Who put her in? Little Tommy Green. Who pulled her out? Big Johnny Stout.
What a naughty boy was that, To drown poor pussy-cat, Who never did him any harm, But killed the mice in his father's barn!


A farmer went riding Upon his gray mare; Bumpety, bumpety, bump! With his daughter behind him, So rosy and fair; Lumpety, lumpety, lump!
A raven cried "Croak!" And they all tumbled down; Bumpety, bumpety, bump! The mare broke her knees, And the farmer his crown; Lumpety, lumpety, lump!
The mischievous raven Flew laughing away; Bumpety, bumpety, bump! And vowed he would serve them The same the next day; Lumpety, lumpety, lump!

Girls and boys, come out to play, The moon is shining as bright as day.
Leave your supper, and leave your sleep, And come with your playfellows into the street.
Come with a whoop, come with a call, Come with a good will or not at all.
Up the ladder and down the wall, A halfpenny roll will serve us all.
You find milk, and I'll find flour, And we'll have pudding in half an hour.

God bless the master of this house,
The mistress, also,
And all the little children,
That round the table go;
And all your kin and kinsmen
That dwell both far and near;
I wish you a Merry Christmas,
And a Happy New Year.

Hey! diddle, diddle,
The cat and the fiddle,
The cow jumped over the moon;
The little dog laughed
To see such sport,
And the dish ran away with the spoon.

Hickory, dickory, dock,
The mouse ran up the clock;
The clock struck one,
The mouse ran down;
Hickory, dickory, dock.

Rock-a-bye, baby,
In the tree top:
When the wind blows,
The cradle will rock;
When the bough breaks,
The cradle will fall;
Down will come baby,
Cradle and all.

I had a little nut-tree, nothing would it bear
But a silver nutmeg and a golden pear;
The king of Spain's daughter came to visit me,
And all because of my little nut-tree.
I skipped over water, I danced over sea.
And all the birds in the air couldn't catch me.

I had a little pony,
His name was Dapple-gray,
I lent him to a lady,
To ride a mile away;
She whipped him, she slashed him,
She rode him through the mire;
I would not lend my pony now
For all the lady's hire.

I have a little sister, they call As I was going to St. Ives,

I have a little sister, they call her Peep, Peep;
She wades the waters deep, deep, deep;
She climbs the mountains high, high, high;
Poor little creature, she has but one eye.

I saw a ship a-sailing, A-sailing on the sea; And oh, it was all laden With pretty things for thee!
There were comfits in the cabin, And apples in the hold; The sails were made of silk, And the masts were made of gold.
The four and twenty sailors, That stood between the decks, Were four and twenty white mice, With chains about their necks.
The captain was a duck, With a packet on his back; And when the ship began to move, The captain said, "Quack, Quack!"
